# Pentesting-for-Dummies
This repo is a bunch of simple, easy-to-use pentesting tools, mostly for webapps, so that lazy devs can secure their websites.

I try to give every file the most obvious name I can think of. Feel free to contribute by submitting a pull request, an issue, or anything else you think is useful. :heart:
